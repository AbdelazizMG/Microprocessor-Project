# Description
- This Project is about Emulating UART/USB Communication Protocol using MATLAB App Designer.

- The Application Reads Two Files:

       1- (conf.json) which contains the configuration for both protocols in json format.
       2- (inputdata.txt) which contains the required data to be plotted.

- The Application then draws the (UART frame - USB Packets) for first (two bytes) of the read data and generates an output file
  in json format containing the (total transmit time - overhead - effeciency) for both protocols.
  
- A comparison between the increase in (total transmit time & overhead) with the increase of the file size for both protocols is also
  plotted in seperate figure.
  
- A Snapshots from the Application is shown below:
